I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from , asterisk make it bold
a _normal distribution_:  , underscores make it italicized.
r code below starts with 3 back ticks and r in brackets (shortcut: alt + ctrl +i)

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! And written text and code can be combined!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
