I’m an R Markdown document\!

# Section 1

Here’s a **code chunk** that samples from , asterisk make it bold a
*normal distribution*: , underscores make it italicized. r code below
starts with 3 back ticks and r in brackets (shortcut: alt + ctrl +i)

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too\! And written text and code can
be combined\! The mean is 0.0264866.
